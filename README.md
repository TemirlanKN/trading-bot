# Telegram Trading Signal Filter Bot

ü§ñ An intelligent bot that monitors Telegram trading channels, filters messages using AI, and forwards only valid trading signals to your Telegram and WhatsApp.

## Features

- üì± **Multi-channel monitoring**: Monitor multiple Telegram channels simultaneously
- ü§ñ **AI-powered filtering**: Uses OpenAI GPT to identify valid trading signals
- üí¨ **Telegram notifications**: Sends filtered signals to your Telegram Saved Messages
- üì≤ **WhatsApp integration**: Forward signals to WhatsApp via Twilio
- üö´ **Smart filtering**: Ignores promotional messages, testimonials, and non-signal content
- ‚è∞ **Real-time processing**: Processes messages as they arrive

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Edit `config.py` with your credentials:

```python
# Telegram API (from https://my.telegram.org/apps)
TELEGRAM_API_ID = 12345678
TELEGRAM_API_HASH = 'your_api_hash_here'

# OpenAI API (from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-openai-key-here"

# Channels to monitor
CHANNELS_TO_MONITOR = [
    'FX_TRADING_01',
    'your_channel_username'
]
```

### 3. Run the Bot

```bash
python signal_filter_enhanced.py
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to:

3. Set up WhatsApp sandbox
4. Update `config.py` with Twilio credentials
